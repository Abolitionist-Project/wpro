Plugin for running your Wordpress site without Write Access to the
web directory. Perfect for sites deployed in a cluster across multiple
webservers!

== Description ==

This plugin will put your media uploads on Amazon S3. Unlike other
S3 plugins, this plugin does not require your uploads to first be
stored in your server's upload directory, so this plugin will work
fine on Wordpress sites where the web server only have read-only
access to the web directory.

*	Wordpress image editing will still work fine (just somewhat slower).
*	Full support for XMLRPC uploads.

This plugin was made for Wordpress sites deployed in a cluster across
multiple webservers, where your web server only have read-only access
to the web directory.

Note: You still need write access to the system /tmp directory for
this plugin to work. It will use the system /tmp directory for
temporary storage during uploads, image editing/scaling, etc.

= Wordpress MU =

We did not test this plugin in a Wordpress MU environment.
It will probably not work out-of-the-box for Wordpress MU.

== Installation ==

1. Put the plugin in the Wordpress `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter your Amazon S3 settings in `Settings` > `WPRO Settings`.
